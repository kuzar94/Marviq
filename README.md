# Housedev.io
HouseDev is a project modeled on the websites of housing developers on which you can view unoccupied flats.
This page allows you to re-rent the flat after providing the details of the potential buyer.

## SVG
The house level diagram is drawn in program named InkSpace as .svg file. Its possible to copy raw file to index.html, but 
I addes some classes to have easier recogniton which element is actualy a flat, beacuse there are also corridors, walls, etc.
## API
On firebase there is my database which has information about rooms and their status, whether they are occupied or reserved. After 
downloading data, by jQuery ajax im color the flats depending on the state. Every flats is getting onClick function. 
## MODAL
Projects has a jQuery library that helps with modals https://jquerymodal.com. Very helpful library but I had some problems with RWD. 
The modal was wider than the maximum width of the mobile device. Bug was fixed.
## Images
All imamages are optimzed, this resulted in faster page loading roughly by 30%. This project was not oriented on performance, 
that's why I did not focus on this in this project.
## BUGS
Did You saw any bug? Contact me please then! :) If all flats are reserved please let me also know. I'll need to reset it :)
